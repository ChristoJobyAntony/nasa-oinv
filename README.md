# INTERACTIVE DATA VISUALIZER

## INTRODUCTION TO WEB APPLICATION

The **Interative Data Visualizer** is a Web App that encompasses 44000+ datasets in a way that is manageable by even amateur researchers. These data sets can be used as referances or for extracting valuable information. 


## HOW WE CREATED IT.

To summarize it we tried to read all the data, find relationships, find nodes, establish connections. We discovered such connections by parsing them through python and found words or phrases that are similar. Then this data was added into Neo4J graphing database.
